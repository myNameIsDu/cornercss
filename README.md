# Corner Css

A simple css theme, It is secondly development from [Doodle CSS](https://github.com/chr15m/DoodleCSS), I love it, But I also have some my own ideas, So I've forked it. Hope you like.

[DEMO](https://mynameisdu.github.io/corner.html)

<img src="https://resource.sunbohao.com/uPic/gbQDAQ.png" alt="gbQDAQ" width='60%'/>

## How to use it

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://resource.sunbohao.com/cornerCss/index-273b31bd39.css" />
```

Then add the class corner to the top level element you want to apply the theme to:

```html
<body class="corner">...</body>
```

Please don't use it in production. Because it's a side project. And the CDN is my own, I will publish it after every build and change.
