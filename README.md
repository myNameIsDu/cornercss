# Corner Css

A simple css theme, It is secondly development from [Doodle CSS](https://github.com/chr15m/DoodleCSS), I love it, But I also have some my own ideas, So I've forked it. Hope you like.

[DEMO](https://mynameisdu.github.io/corner.html)

## How to use it

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://resource.sunbohao.com/cornerCss/index-273b31bd39.css" />
```

Please don't use it in production. Because it's a side project. And the cnd is my own, I will publish it after every build and change.
